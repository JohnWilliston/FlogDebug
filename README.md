# Overview

This repo was born when I posted [Issue #155 on the rbong/vim-flog](https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog/issues/155) GitHub repo. I was asked to provide my Neovim configuration and supply a repo that has the problem, so here we go!

# Reproducing the problem

1. Use the Neovim configuration in the `nvim` folder in this repo. 
2. Navigate to this repo where you've checked it out. 
3. Notice that the `:!git log` command works just fine in Neovim.
4. Now try `:Flog` and notice how some activity occurs but shows you an empty window.

I feel like I'm missing something completely obvious.
